# Tutoring Marketplace Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Tutoring Marketplace** aims to create a decentralized platform that connects tutors with students in an efficient and transparent manner. Leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology, this project envisions a secure and immutable environment for managing tutoring sessions, facilitating payments, and ensuring trust between users. By removing intermediaries, we aim to provide a seamless experience for both tutors and students, making education more accessible and rewarding.

## Features

   - Tutors can set their own prices for sessions, promoting fair market value.
   - Students can view available sessions and their respective prices clearly.

### 3. **Secure Payment System**
   - The smart contract handles payment transactions between students and tutors using the AptosCoin.
   - Payments are securely withdrawn from the student and deposited to the tutor's account upon booking a session.

### 4. **Session Management**
   - Tutors can initialize their accounts, creating a storage space for their tutoring sessions.
   - The system allows tutors to track their sessions and students to book available slots easily.

### 5. **Real-Time Booking**
